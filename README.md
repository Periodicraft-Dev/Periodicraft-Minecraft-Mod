>Periodicraft is a mod created by a few kids, and is partially open-source. It is still being worked on and will add all of the periodic elements, but also many other fun things, for instance, mobs may be harder to fight, you can build spaceships to take you to different planets, collecting new resources at each one.
>Periodicraft also offers several new items you can't normally get in Minecraft like a bunch of new armor, and a ton of new entities and mobs such as.....Penguins! For now, however, we are limited to a bunch the metallic elements andâ€¦ no penguins. :(
